# LeetCode-Helper

just some guidance and a little help on how to improve by using LeetCode using open source libraries. That's it!



**1. Importing Libraries:** Imports `requests` for making HTTP requests and `json` for handling JSON data.

**2. Ollama API Configuration:**

* `OLLAMA_API_KEY = 'your_ollama_api_key'`:  **Replace `'your_ollama_api_key'` with your actual Ollama API key.**
* `OLLAMA_API_URL`: The URL for the Ollama API endpoint.

**3. `get_ollama_solution` Function:**

```python
def get_ollama_solution(problem_statement):
    # ...
```

* Takes the `problem_statement` (the LeetCode problem description) as input.
* Constructs the request headers:
    * `Authorization`: Includes the API key for authentication.
    * `Content-Type`: Specifies that the request body is in JSON format.
* Creates the request data as a dictionary with the `problem_statement`.
* `response = requests.post(...)`: Sends a POST request to the Ollama API with the headers and data.
* Checks the response status code:
    * If 200 (OK), returns the JSON response.
    * Otherwise, returns an error message.

**4. `main` Function:**

```python
def main():
    # ...
```

* Prints a welcome message.
* Enters a loop that continues until the user types 'exit'.
* Prompts the user to enter a LeetCode problem statement.
* If the input is 'exit', prints a goodbye message and breaks the loop.
* Prints a message indicating that the problem is being sent to Ollama.
* Calls `get_ollama_solution` to get the solution.
* Checks for errors in the solution:
    * If an error is present, prints the error message.
    * Otherwise, prints the solution received from Ollama.

**5. Main Execution Block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Calls the `main` function when the script is executed directly.

**Key Improvements and Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code includes basic error handling by checking the response status code. You could add more robust error handling (e.g., checking for specific error codes, handling timeouts).
* **Input Validation:** Consider adding input validation to handle cases where the user enters empty or invalid problem statements.
* **Clearer Output:** You could format the output to make it more readable, especially if the Ollama API returns code or complex data structures.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Be mindful of rate limits imposed by the Ollama API. You might need to add logic to handle rate limiting errors or introduce delays between requests if necessary.
* **Asynchronous Operations:**  Consider using asynchronous operations (e.g., `aiohttp` instead of `requests`) for improved performance, especially if the Ollama API calls can take some time.
